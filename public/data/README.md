# Data Directory

Place your Excel file `NCAA Mens basketball Data (2).xlsx` in this directory.

The Excel file should contain sheets named:
- **Teams** - Team statistics and data
- **Players** - Player statistics and data  
- **Transfers** - Transfer records and data

If your sheet names are different, the app will attempt to match them automatically based on similar names.
